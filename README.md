2. Install Necessary Extensions in VS Code
Open VS Code, go to the Extensions Marketplace (on the left sidebar), and install the following:
ESLint: Ensures your code follows consistent formatting and quality checks.
Prettier: Automatically formats your code to be neat and consistent.
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense: Provides autocompletion and linting for Tailwind CSS classes.
JavaScript (ES6) code snippets: Provides shortcuts for React and JavaScript.
MongoDB for VS Code: Allows you to connect to MongoDB databases directly from VS Code and manage data.
GitLens: Helps with version control and Git tracking.
VS Code Icons: This isn’t mandatory, but it adds file icons for better visual organization.


3. Install Node.js
Download and install Node.js from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). This will include npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll need to install dependencies and run your project.
Verify the installation by running:
node -v
npm -v
in the terminal.

Expected output (foi bem feito):
v20.17.0
10.8.2
